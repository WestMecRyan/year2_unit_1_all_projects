Practice exercises (15 minutes):

Have students create an object representing a book with properties like title, author, year, and genres (as an array).

Ask them to use Object.keys() to list all the properties of their book object.

Have them use Object.values() to create an array of all the values in their book object.

Challenge them to create a new object that combines their book object with additional information (e.g., publisher, ISBN) using the spread operator.

As an advanced exercise, ask them to write a function that takes their book object and returns a new object with only the title and author properties.
